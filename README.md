# Computational Geometry Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects related to computational geometry.
Developed using an adapted version of the CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) built by Ricardo Dutra da Silva, Federal University of Technology - Parana - Brazil.

## Overview

This repository aims to provide hands-on experience in implementing algorithms and solving problems in computational geometry. It includes exercises that cover concepts and can be extended to more complex projects.
